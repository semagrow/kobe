<h2>Federation Management</h2>

<a href="../Index.html">back</a>

<p>FedX federations can be managed both at initialization and at runtime. This is possible
since FedX is capable of on-demand federation setup, meaning that we do not require any
prior knowledge about data sources.</p>

<p>The federation can be controlled at runtime using the <i>FederationManager</i>. This class
provides all means for interacting with the federation at runtime, e.g. adding or removing
federation members.</p>

<p>Endpoints can be added to the federation using the methods <i>addEndpoint(Endpoint)</i> and
removed with <i>removeEndpoint(endpoint)</i>. Note that new endpoints can be initialized using
our <a href="endpointManager.html">Endpoint Management</a> facilities.</p>

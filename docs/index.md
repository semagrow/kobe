# Welcome to KOBE

KOBE is a benchmarking system that leverages [Docker](https://docker.io) and
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) in order to reproduce experiments of
federated query processing in a collections of data sources.

## Overview

In the SPARQL query processing community, as well as in the wider databases
community, benchmark reproducibility is based on releasing datasets and query
workloads. However, this paradigm breaks down for federated query processors, as
these systems do not manage the data they serve to their clients but provide a
data-integration abstraction over the actual query processors that are in direct
contact with the data.

The KOBE benchmarking engine is a system that aims to provide a generic platform
to perform benchmarking and experimentation that can be reproducible in
different environments. It was designed with the following objectives in mind:

1. to allow for benchmark and experiment specifications to be reproduced in
   different environments and be able to produce comparable and reliable
   results;
2. to ease the deployment of complex benchmarking experiments by automating the
   tedious tasks of initialization and execution.

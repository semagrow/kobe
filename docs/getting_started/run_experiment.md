# Perform a benchmark experiment

In the following, we show the steps for deploying an experiment on a simple
benchmark that comprises three queries over a [semagrow] federation of two
Virtuoso endpoints.

You can use the [kobectl] found in the
[bin](https://github.com/semagrow/kobe/tree/devel/bin) directory for controlling
your experiments:

```
export PATH=`pwd`/bin:$PATH
kobectl help
```

First, apply the templates for Virtuoso and [semagrow]:

```sh
kobectl apply examples/dataset-virtuoso/virtuosotemplate.yaml
kobectl apply examples/federator-semagrow/semagrowtemplate.yaml
```

Then, apply the benchmark.

```sh
kobectl apply examples/benchmark-toybench/toybench-simple.yaml
```

Before running the experiment, you should verify that the datasets are loaded.
Use the following command:

```
kobectl show benchmark toybench-simple
```

When the datasets are loaded, you should get the following output:

```
NAME  STATUS
toy1  Running
toy2  Running
```

Proceed now with the execution of the experiment:

```
kobectl apply examples/experiment-toybench/toyexp-simple.yaml
```

As previously, you can review the state of the experiment with the following
command:

```
kobectl show experiment toyexp-simple
```
You can now view the evaluation metrics in the Kibana dashboards.

For removing all of the above, issue the following commands:
```
kobectl delete experiment toyexp-simple
kobectl delete benchmark toybench-simple
kobectl delete federatortemplate semagrowtemplate
kobectl delete datasettemplate virtuosotemplate
```
For more advanced control options for KOBE, use [kubectl].

# Create a new experiment

This walkthrough illustrates the steps required from the *experimenter* in order
to create an [Experiment] specification.

In KOBE, an experiment is defined over a benchmark and federator. This resource
provides the necessary parameters for instantiating a federation of querying
systems.

## Prerequisites

In this walkthrough we assume that you already have already prepared the
following:

* A [Benchmark] for the benchmark you want to use in your experiment.
* A [FederatorTemplate] for the federation engine you want to use in your
  experiment.
* A docker image of the evaluator, which is a piece of software that will pose
  the queries to the federator.

We have already prepared several benchmarks and federator templates to use. If
you want to create your own benchmark, check out [this
guide](create_benchmark.md). Moreover, if you want to create your own federator
template, check out [this guide](../extend/add_federator.md). Regarding the
evaluator, we currently we offer the docker image
`semagrow/kobe-sequential-evaluator`, which executes the queries of the
benchmark in a sequential manner. If you want to create your own evaluator,
check out [this guide](../extend/add_evaluator.md).

## Step 1. Prepare your YAML file

An experiment is characterized by its *name* and is parameterized with a
*benchmark* to be executed and a *federator template* to be used. A typical
experiment specification should look like this:

``` yaml
apiVersion: kobe.semagrow.org/v1alpha1
kind: Experiment
metadata:
  # Each experiment can be uniquely identified by its name.
  name: myexperiment
spec:
  # Specify the name of the benchmark to be executed.
  benchmark: mybench
  
  # Specify the name of the federation engine of the experiment.
  federatorName: myfederator
  
  # Specify the name of the federator template to be used.
  federatorTemplateRef: federatortemplate
  
  # Specify the docker image of the evaluator.
  evaluator:
    image: semagrow/kobe-sequential-evaluator
  
  # Specify the number of runs of the experiment, i.e. how many times each query 
  # of the benchmark should be executed.
  timesToRun: runs
  
  # If you set this parameter to true, KOBE will only build the federation 
  # and will not start the experiment.
  dryRun: false
  
  # If you set this parameter to false, KOBE will not build the federation
  # if it was already built in previous executions of this experiment.
  forceNewInit: true 
```

Check the following link in which we illustrate a simple example of the above
specification:

* [experiment-toybench/toyexp-simple.yaml](https://github.com/semagrow/kobe/tree/devel/examples/experiment-toybench/toyexp-simple.yaml)

In this example, we define an experiment over the `toybench-simple` benchmark,
and we use the Semagrow federation engine. The queries of the benchmark are
executed in a sequential manner, and each query of the benchmark is executed 3
times. Since `toybench-simple` contains the queries `tq1`, `tq2`, `tq3`, in the
example experiment the queries will be executed with the following order: `tq1`,
`tq2`, `tq3`, `tq1`, `tq2`, `tq3`, `tq1`, `tq2`, `tq3`.

## Examples

We have already prepared several experiment specifications to experiment with:

* [experiment-fedbench](https://github.com/semagrow/kobe/tree/devel/examples/experiment-fedbench)
* [experiment-geofedbench](https://github.com/semagrow/kobe/tree/devel/examples/experiment-geofedbench)
* [experiment-geographica](https://github.com/semagrow/kobe/tree/devel/examples/experiment-geographica)
* [experiment-toybench](https://github.com/semagrow/kobe/tree/devel/examples/experiment-toybench)

!!! note
    We plan to define more experiment specifications in the future. We place all
    benchmark specifications in the
    [examples/](https://github.com/semagrow/kobe/tree/devel/examples/) directory
    under a subdirectory with the prefix `experiment-*`.
